## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 

### What I learned

This project was amongst my first Frontend mentor challanges, i think i learned a lot about grid and flex, how to place the items where they should be. I also learned how to use the :hover pseudo class, and how to use it to make the page more interactive. I also learned how to use the box-shadow property, and how to use it to make the page more interesting. I also learned how to use the @media rule, and how to use it to make the page responsive. Altough i know this project is not perfect, i think i learned a lot from it, and i think i will be able to use the knowledge i gained from this project in the future.

### Continued development

I dont think i will try to improve the code in the future.
